                    Decided to revisit the TRAUMA that was coding so I could make you this janky website to express my birthday wishes lol. But it was all worth it because you’re def worthy of the extra effort as my great great friend :) I wanted to say “thank you” for sticking with me throughout all of this university and graphic design bs. It’s helpful to know you’re there in my corner whether I need some consolation, a laugh, or just a friend. And I really hope I can be at least half of that person for you too. I cherish our friendship a lot, not only because you’re one of the few people to befriend me at school, but because of how awesome you are. You’re genuinely one of the sweetest, kindest, most thoughtful people I’ve come across and I feel so grateful for you as a friend. (Also, you have the best eyebrows I’ve come across like um share ur tips???) Happy Birthday, and here’s to more years of our blossoming friendship and that 2nd Tamil movie! *clinks champagne glass*
